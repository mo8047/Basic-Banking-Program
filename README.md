# Python CLI Banking App 

A basic Command Line Interface (CLI) banking simulation in Python that allows users to:

- Deposit money  
- Withdraw funds  
- Check account balance

Built using beginner-level concepts: **functions**, **loops**, and **conditional statements**.

# Features

- Simple menu-driven interface
- Input validation (e.g., no negative deposits)
- Persistent session balance (until user exits the program)

# How It Works

Users interact with the app via terminal prompts. It displays a menu where they can choose an action (show balance, deposit, withdraw, or exit). The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
